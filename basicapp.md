# A basic web app

In this exercise we will create a very simple web app that lets the user increment or decrement a value.

## Create a new, empty project

Create a new folder and run elm init.

```cmd
> elm init
```

## Add code

Create a new file called **Main.elm** in th **/src** folder. Copy-paste the following code.

```elm
module Main exposing(..)

import Browser
import Html exposing (Html, button, div, text)
import Html.Events exposing (onClick)

main =
  Browser.sandbox { init = 0, update = update, view = view }

type Msg = Increment | Decrement

update msg model =
  case msg of
    Increment ->
      model + 1

    Decrement ->
      model - 1

view model =
  div []
    [ button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text "-" ]
    , div [] [ text (String.fromInt model) ]
    , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
    ]
```

## Run the application

Start up elm reactor (which is a simple http server that comes with the elm-lang framework).

```
> elm reactor
```

Surf to http://localhost:8000/ and locate Main.elm and click it to start the application. Try the increment and decrement buttons. 


## Take a look at the code

* The syntax of elm is quite terse 
* Elm uses indention to define code blocks in contrast to curly brackets for example.
* ```{ field_a = 1, field_b = 2 }``` creates a record data structure
* ```type Msg = Increment | Decrement``` is a union type. Its like an enum type but better.
* The ```case ... of``` is a pattern matching expression
* ```[1, 2, 3]``` is a list of integers
* Html is generated by functions such as ```button``` and ```div```. Typically such a function takes a list of attributes as the first argument and a list of sub elements as the second argument.
