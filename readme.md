# Background
>Elm is a delightful functional language for reliable webapps. It compiles to JavaScript, has great performance, no runtime exceptions, and can be embedded easily into existing JS projects without the need for huge rewrites or time investment.

In this workshop we will get familiar with [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) by hands on exercises. No previous experience of web development nor functional programming is required.
