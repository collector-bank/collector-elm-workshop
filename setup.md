# Setup dev environment

## Install elm language
Elm lang installation instructions are available  on the  [elm-lang web site](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html).

Elm is also available via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/elm).

```cmd
> npm install -g elm@latest-0.19.1
```

## Install elm test framework

Install the Elm [test framework](https://github.com/elm-explorations/test) using npm.

```cmd
> npm install -g elm-test
```

## Text editing

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for this workshop (but anything goes really).

Add the [Elm Plugin for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Elmtooling.elm-ls-vscode) as well for syntax highlighting etc.
